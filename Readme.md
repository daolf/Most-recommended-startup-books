# The 25 most recommended startup books of all-time.

There are countless lists on the internet claiming to be **the** list of must-read startup books and it seemed that all those lists always recommended that same books minus two or three odd choices.


I wanted to find out what were the most recommended books about startups, and so I've made this. I've compiled more than **208 lists** and almost **4,000** recommendations found on the internet. To my knowledge, this is the most complete list of its kind on the subject.

*Disclaimer: I spent countless hours on this article so I've decided to put Amazon affiliation links to see if those kinds of detailed articles could be a viable source of revenue, ... or not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.*

If you want to jump right on the results go take a look below at the [full results](#the-25-most-recommended-startup-books-of-alltime). If you want to learn about the methodology, bear with me.

## Methodology:

I've simply asked Google for a few queries like "Best Startup Books", "Best entrepreneur books" and other variations of it. I have then scrapped all those pages (using ScrapingBee, a web scraping API I'm working on).

I've deduplicated the links and ended up with nearly 300 links. Using the title of the pages I was also able to quickly discards:

- list focussed on one particular editor
- list focussed on one particular topic (i.e "Best Book for Crypto Entrepreneur")
- list focussed on free books
- Quora and Reddit threads

I ended up with 254 HTML files. I went on opening all the files on my browser, open my chrome inspector, found and wrote the CSS selector matching book titles in the article. This took me around 2hours, almost 30 seconds per page. 

This also allowed me to discard even more nonrelevant pages. 

At this moment I had this big JSON file referencing the HTML page previously scrapped, and a CSS selector.

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/rules.png)

Using Python with Beautiful soup, I've extracted every text inside DOM elements that matched the CSS selector. I ended up with a huge list of books, not usable without some post-processing.

![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/links.png)

To find the most quoted startup books I needed to normalize my results. As a matter of fact, a book like "7 habits of highly effective people" appeared on my results using 3 different titles:

- 7 habits of highly effective people
- Seven habits of highly effective people
- 7 habits for highly for effective people

This plus all the different variation like "{title} by {author}" or "{title} - {author}" made this task a bit tricky.

I ended up doing it using this simple custom Python function:
```python
def clean_link(link):
    link = link.encode().decode('ascii', errors='ignore')
    link = link.replace("'", '')
    link = link.lower()
    link = ' '.join([w for w in link.split(' ') if w not in ['the', 'a']])
    link = link.split('by')[0]
    link = link.split(':')[0]
    link = link.split('(')[0]
    link = ' '.join(link.split())
    link = link.replace('-', '_')
    link = ''.join([c for c in link if c.isalpha() or c == '_' or c == ' '])
    link = link.strip()
    link = link.replace(' ', '_')
    link = ''.join([c for c in link if c.isalpha() or c == '_'])
    return link
```
 and quite a bit of manual cleaning.

My list now looked like this:

From there it was easy to compute the most recommended books. You can find all the data used to process this list on this [repo](https://github.com/daolf/Most-recommended-startup-books). Now let's look at the list:

"In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? 

His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band."

"Most business books give you the same old advice: Write a business plan, study the competition, seek investors, yadda yadda. If you're looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf.

Read it and you'll know why plans are actually harmful, why you don't need outside investors, and why you're better off ignoring the competition. The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses. 

What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.

With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who‚Äôs ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, victims of "downsizing," and artists who don‚Äôt want to starve anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages."

### 10. [Start with Why](https://amzn.to/2wikE8l) by Simon Sinek (14.4% recommended)
    
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/10.jpg#center)

"Sinek starts with a fundamental question: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?
 
People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. 
 
START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way -- and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/2wikE8l)

### 9. [Think and Grow Rich](https://amzn.to/39DlcUN) by Napoleon Hill (14.4% recommended)
    
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/9.jpg#center)

"Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.
The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.

In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/39DlcUN)

### 8. [Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't](https://amzn.to/37wvV1U) by Jim Collins  (14.9% recommended)
    
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/8.jpg#center)

"Five years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, "Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?" In Good to Great Collins, the author of Built to Last, concludes that it is possible, but finds there are no silver bullets. Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider. Like Built to Last, Good to Great is one of those books that managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/37wvV1U)

"Still in his early thirties, Chris is on the verge of completing a tour of every country on earth ‚Äì he‚Äôs already visited more than 175 nations ‚Äì and yet he‚Äôs never held a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù or earned a regular paycheck.

There are many others like Chris ‚Äì those who‚Äôve found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful.  Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn‚Äôt depend on shelving what you currently do.

### 2. [Zero to One](https://amzn.to/3bIB1Lw) by Peter Thiel (29.3% recommended)
    
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/2.jpg#center)

"The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.

Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we‚Äôre too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.

Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won‚Äôt make a search engine. Tomorrow‚Äôs champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today‚Äôs marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.

Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3bIB1Lw)

### 1. [The Lean Startup](https://amzn.to/3bBJtwp) by Eric Ries (44.7% recommended)
    
![](https://www.daolf.com/images/book_list/1.jpg#center)

"Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.

The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on ‚Äúvalidated learning,‚Äù rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.

Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs‚Äîin companies of all sizes‚Äîa way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it‚Äôs too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever." [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3bBJtwp)


## Conclusion

Although the order might suprise some, by definition, most of you must have heard of these book already.

A few additional things I learned making this list: 
- Tim Ferriss is the only author with several books in the list.
- The Bible was quoted one time
- The [Steve Jobs biography](https://amzn.to/2SKalRW) by Walter Isaacson is the most quoted biography, being recommended by 6% of the article.

I hope you enjoyed this article.
